        I am not sure what we are but I think we are more than 1. My aproach to
        this is that the oposite of TRUE en all Cases are TRUE in some cases.
        Basic logic. We are an anomely and have been interacting with other
        stuff for generations, we are evolving slower than we are thinking. Free
        will might be an illusion since Life itself seem to follow its own path
        and I think we are alive.
